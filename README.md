# About the Project 
![Alt text](/assets/ant-trail-walking-colony-black-600nw-2494508395.webp "Ant Trails")

This project comes from Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering's Scientific Computing Spring 2026 class. This is the first project, 
which focuses on agent-based following with ant trail formation. The project follows "Modelling the Formation of Trail Networks by 
Foraging Ants” James Watmough and Leah Edelstein-Keshet. The goal of this project is to to model ant trail formation using a 
cellular automata simulation, that looks similar to Figure 3 in the paper. 

# Built With
* Python and its videos
    * Pygame
    * Numpy
    * Pytest

# Getting Started
Before getting started we need to set up the project to be to run on your machine locally. To get a local copy up and running 
follow these simple example steps.

## Prerequisites
These are the list of Python libraries needed to and how to install it. 
* Pygame
  ```sh
  pip install pygame
  ```
* Numpy
  ```sh
  pip install numpy
  ```

* Pytest
  ```sh
  pip install pytest
  ```

# Paper Documentation
As mentioned above this project is based on "Modelling the Formation of Trail Networks by Foraging Ants” James Watmough and
Leah Edelstein-Keshet. Please refer to the paper linked below if you have any further questions or more research insights.
